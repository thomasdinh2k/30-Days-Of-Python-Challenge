Commit your changes: Run the command git commit -m "Your commit message" to commit the changes.
Replace "Your commit message" with a concise and descriptive message that explains the changes you made.


Check the status of your repository: Before committing changes, it's a good practice to check the status of your repository.
Open your command line or terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the command git status. It will show you the modified files and any untracked files.

Add files to the commit: Use the command git add <file> to add specific files to the commit.
For example, git add myfile.txt will add the file myfile.txt. If you want to add all modified and untracked files, you can use git add .

Commit the changes: Run the command git commit -m "Your commit message" to commit the changes.
Replace "Your commit message" with a concise and descriptive message that explains the changes you made.

Push to GitHub: Finally, run the command git push origin <branch> to push your local commits to GitHub.
Replace <branch> with the name of the branch you want to push to. For example, if you want to push to the main branch, the command would be git push origin main.

Provide GitHub credentials (if necessary): If this is your first time pushing to the repository or if you haven't authenticated with GitHub on your machine,
Git might prompt you to enter your GitHub username and password. Enter your credentials when prompted.
